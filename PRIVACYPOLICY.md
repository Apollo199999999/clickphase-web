# Privacy Policy for this website ("ClickPhase")

By using the website "ClickPhase" you are consenting to our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information set out in this privacy policy.

## Collection of Personal Information

* We do not collect, store, use or share any information, personal or otherwise. 
* This website does not use any cookies at all. 
* This website utilises Vercel Analytics, which includes both Vercel Web Vitals and Vercel Audiences, to improve user experience.
* However, despite this, Vercel has stated that for  Vercel Web Vitals, "to ensure that the Web Vitals feature can be used despite many different regulatory limitations around the world, we've designed it in such a way that it provides you with information without being tied to, or associated with, any individual visitor or IP address.
The recording of data points is anonymous and the Analytics feature does not collect or store information that would enable us to reconstruct a browsing session across pages or identify a user"   
**(Source: https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/analytics/privacy)**
* Additionally, Vercel also states that for Vercel Audiences, "instead of relying on cookies like many analytics products, visitors are identified by a hash created from the incoming request. Using a generated hash provides a privacy-friendly experience for your visitors and means visitors can't be tracked between different days or different websites. The generated hash is valid for a single day, at which point it is automatically reset.
If a visitor loads your website for the first time, we immediately track this visit as a page view. Subsequent page views are tracked via the native Browser API."   
**(Source: https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/analytics/audiences)**
* Data collected by Vercel Analytics is covered under Vercel's privacy policy, and is not our responsibility.
