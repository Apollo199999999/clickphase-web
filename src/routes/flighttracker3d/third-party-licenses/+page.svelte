  <p>Version 2, June 1991</p>

  <pre>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>

  <span id="SEC2"></span>
  <h4 id="preamble">Preamble</h4>

  <p>
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended
    to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure
    the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies
    to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program
    whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation
    software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You
    can apply it to your programs, too.
  </p>

  <p>
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
    General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
    to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you
    wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
    can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
    you know you can do these things.
  </p>

  <p>
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
    deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
    copies of the software, or if you modify it.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
    for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You
    must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you
    must show them these terms so they know their rights.
  </p>

  <p>
    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
    offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
    and/or modify the software.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
    everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If
    the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
    recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any
    problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'
    reputations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
    wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be
    licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
  </p>

  <p>
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
    follow.
  </p>

  <span id="SEC3"></span>
  <h4 id="terms">
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  </h4>

  <p id="section0">
    <strong>0.</strong>
    This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed
    by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
    General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work,
    and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative
    work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
  </p>

  <p>
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
    by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program
    is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
    contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
    made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
    Program does.
  </p>

  <p id="section1">
    <strong>1.</strong>
    You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
    receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
    publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;
    keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of
    any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
    along with the Program.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
    may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
  </p>

  <p id="section2">
    <strong>2.</strong>
    You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
    forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
    or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
    these conditions:
  </p>

  <dl style="padding-left: 4em;">
    <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>a)</strong>
      You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you
      changed the files and the date of any change.
    </dd>
    <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>b)</strong>
      You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in
      part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed
      as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
    </dd>
    <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>c)</strong>
      If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you
      must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary
      way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright
      notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions,
      and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the
      Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,
      your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
    sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
    reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
    this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
    distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections
    as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
    the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
    licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
    regardless of who wrote it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
    rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
    the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
    based on the Program.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
    the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage
    or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
    License.
  </p>

  <p id="section3">
    <strong>3.</strong>
    You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section
    2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
    provided that you also do one of the following:
  </p>

  <!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
  <!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->

  <dl style="padding-left: 4em;">
    <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>a)</strong>
      Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
      which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
      customarily used for software interchange; or,
    </dd>
    <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>b)</strong>
      Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
      any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
      source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
      source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on
      a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    </dd>
    <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>c)</strong>
      Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
      corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial
      distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable
      form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
    modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all
    the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
    definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
    installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
    code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
    either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
    and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
    component itself accompanies the executable.
  </p>

  <p>
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
    copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
    source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
    even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with
    the object code.
  </p>

  <p id="section4">
    <strong>4.</strong>
    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly
    provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense
    or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
    you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.
  </p>

  <p id="section5">
    <strong>5.</strong>
    You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,
    nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its
    derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
    License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based
    on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or
    works based on it.
  </p>

  <p id="section6">
    <strong>6.</strong>
    Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the
    recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
    distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may
    not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
    granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties
    to this License.
  </p>

  <p id="section7">
    <strong>7.</strong>
    If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
    or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed
    on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions
    of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.
    If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
    this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
    not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not
    permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
    directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
    it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
  </p>

  <p>
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
    the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
    or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
    this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
    software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
    practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
    software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
    application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
    she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a
    licensee cannot impose that choice.
  </p>

  <p>
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
    consequence of the rest of this License.
  </p>

  <p id="section8">
    <strong>8.</strong>
    If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries
    either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder
    who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
    limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
    in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
  </p>

  <p id="section9">
    <strong>9.</strong>
    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General
    Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit
    to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
    Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of
    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
    Foundation.
  </p>

  <p id="section10">
    <strong>10.</strong>
    If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose
    distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.
    For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the
    Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision
    will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives
    of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
  </p>

  <p id="section11"><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>

  <p>
    <strong>11.</strong>
    BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
    PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
    IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS
    IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
    NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS
    WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
    SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  </p>

  <p id="section12">
    <strong>12.</strong>
    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
    COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM
    AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
    INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
    THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
    TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
  </p>

  <h4>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h4>

  <span id="SEC4"></span>
  <h4 id="howto">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h4>

  <p>
    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
    use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
    which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
  </p>

  <p>
    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
    exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright"
    line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
  </p>

  <pre><var
      >one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.</var>
Copyright (C) <var>yyyy</var>  <var>name of author</var>
    
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
    
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.
    
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.
</pre>

  <p>
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when
    it starts in an interactive mode:
  </p>

  <pre>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) <var>year</var> <var
      >name of author</var>
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' 
for details.
    </pre>

  <p>
    The hypothetical commands <samp>`show w'</samp> and <samp>`show c'</samp>
    should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the
    commands you use may be called something other than
    <samp>`show w'</samp>
    and
    <samp>`show c'</samp>; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu
    items--whatever suits your program.
  </p>

  <p>
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
  </p>

    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
    proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may
    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
    library. If this is what you want to do, use the
    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html"

            in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original

            Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at
            least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.
            For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
            Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,
            by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly
            or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
            by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate,
            of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
            permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

    Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;<a
      href="https://fsf.org/">https://fsf.org/</a

    <br />
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
    document, but changing it is not allowed.
  </p>

  <h4 id="preamble">Preamble</h4>

  <p>
    The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
    software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
    cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
  </p>

  <p>
    The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
    take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our
    General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
    change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for
    all its users.
  </p>

  <p>
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
    General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
    to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish),
    that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can
    change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you
    know you can do these things.
  </p>

  <p>
    Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two
    steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
    which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
    software.
  </p>

  <p>
    A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements
    made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use,
    become available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of
    free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation.
    However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may
    fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified
    version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing
    its source code to the public.
  </p>

  <p>
    The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure
    that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the
    community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the
    source code of the modified version running there to the users of that
    server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly
    accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the
    modified version.
  </p>

  <p>
    An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by
    Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different
    license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new
    version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.
  </p>

  <p>
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
    follow.
  </p>

  <h4 id="terms">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h4>

  <h4 id="section0">0. Definitions.</h4>

  <p>
    "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
    works, such as semiconductor masks.
  </p>

  <p>
    "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
    Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be
    individuals or organizations.
  </p>

  <p>
    To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
    fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact
    copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work
    or a work "based on" the earlier work.
  </p>

  <p>
    A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the
    Program.
  </p>

  <p>
    To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
    would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under
    applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a
    private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without
    modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other
    activities as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties
    to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer
    network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
  </p>

  <p>
    An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the
    extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that
    (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that
    there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are
    provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to
    view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user
    commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
    criterion.
  </p>

  <h4 id="section1">1. Source Code.</h4>

  <p>
    The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
    modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.
  </p>

  <p>
    A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
    standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
    interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
    widely used among developers working in that language.
  </p>

  <p>
    The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than
    the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a
    Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b)
    serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to
    implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to
    the public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means
    a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
    specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a
    compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run
    it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
    source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run
    the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those
    activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or
    general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used
    unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the
    work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
    associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
    libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
    designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow
    between those subprograms and other parts of the work.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
    automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.
  </p>

  <h4 id="section2">2. Basic Permissions.</h4>

  <p>
    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright
    on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
    This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the
    unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by
    this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered
    work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent,
    as provided by copyright law.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
    without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You
    may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make
    modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for
    running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License
    in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus
    making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
    behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from
    making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship
    with you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
    conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
    unnecessary.
  </p>

  <h4 id="section3">
    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
  </h4>

  <p>
    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
    under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
    copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or
    restricting circumvention of such measures.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
    circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is
    effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered
    work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of
    the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third
    parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.
  </p>

  <h4 id="section4">4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h4>

  <p>
    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
    it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
    on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices
    stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with
    section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any
    warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the
    Program.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you
    may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
  </p>

  <h4 id="section5">5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h4>

  <p>
    You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce
    it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section
    4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and
      giving a relevant date.
    </li>

    <li>
      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under
      this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement
      modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".
    </li>

    <li>
      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
      anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore
      apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole
      of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This
      License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it
      does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
    </li>

    <li>
      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need
      not make them do so.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
    which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are
    not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
    compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or
    legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works
    permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
    License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
  </p>

  <h4 id="section6">6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h4>

  <p>
    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
    sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
    Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used
      for software interchange.
    </li>

    <li>
      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
      offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer
      spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who
      possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source
      for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
      durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a
      price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
      conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a
      network server at no charge.
    </li>

    <li>
      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
      offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed
      only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object
      code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
    </li>

    <li>
      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
      (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding
      Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You
      need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with
      the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server,
      the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or
      a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you
      maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
      Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding
      Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
      needed to satisfy these requirements.
    </li>

    <li>
      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
      inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the
      work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection
      6d.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from
    the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in
    conveying the object code work.
  </p>

  <p>
    A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
    tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or
    household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into
    a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful
    cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product
    received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common
    use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular
    user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or
    is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless
    of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or
    non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of
    use of the product.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
    authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute
    modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified
    version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure
    that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case
    prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
    specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of
    a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product
    is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term
    (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding
    Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation
    Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any
    third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
    Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).
  </p>

  <p>
    The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
    requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for
    a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
    Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may
    be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
    operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
    communication across the network.
  </p>

  <p>
    Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in
    accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented
    (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form),
    and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or
    copying.
  </p>

  <h4 id="section7">7. Additional Terms.</h4>

  <p>
    "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License
    by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional
    permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as
    though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid
    under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the
    Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
    entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the
    additional permissions.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
    additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
    permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases
    when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material,
    added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate
    copyright permission.
  </p>

  <p>
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to
    a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that
    material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms
      of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
    </li>

    <li>
      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
      attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
      displayed by works containing it; or
    </li>

    <li>
      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
      requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable
      ways as different from the original version; or
    </li>

    <li>
      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
      authors of the material; or
    </li>

    <li>
      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
      names, trademarks, or service marks; or
    </li>

    <li>
      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
      anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
      contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability
      that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and
      authors.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
    restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
    received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
    governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,
    you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further
    restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may
    add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license
    document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such
    relicensing or conveying.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
    place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms
    that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the
    applicable terms.
  </p>

  <p>
    Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of
    a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above
    requirements apply either way.
  </p>

  <h4 id="section8">8. Termination.</h4>

  <p>
    You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided
    under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,
    and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including
    any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
  </p>

  <p>
    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from
    a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and
    until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license,
    and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the
    violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
    permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
    reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
    violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you
    cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
  </p>

  <p>
    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this
    License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated,
    you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under
    section 10.
  </p>

  <h4 id="section9">9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h4>

  <p>
    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
    copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring
    solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy
    likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this
    License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These
    actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
    modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of
    this License to do so.
  </p>

  <h4 id="section10">10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h4>

  <p>
    Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
    license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
    subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
    third parties with this License.
  </p>

  <p>
    An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
    organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
    organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
    results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
    receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the
    party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
    paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the
    work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get
    it with reasonable efforts.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
    granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a
    license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under
    this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim
    or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by
    making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any
    portion of it.
  </p>

  <h4 id="section11">11. Patents.</h4>

  <p>
    A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License
    of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus
    licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
  </p>

  <p>
    A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
    controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
    acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License,
    of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include
    claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification
    of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control"
    includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with
    the requirements of this License.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
    license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,
    offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents
    of its contributor version.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
    agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such
    as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for
    patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to
    make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the
    party.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the
    Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free
    of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available
    network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1)
    cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
    yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or
    (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License,
    to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying"
    means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your
    conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the
    covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents
    in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.
  </p>

  <p>
    If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,
    you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and
    grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work
    authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the
    covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to
    all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.
  </p>

  <p>
    A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope
    of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the
    non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted
    under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to
    an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing
    software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the
    extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third
    party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from
    you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the
    covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b)
    primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
    contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that
    patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
    implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
    available to you under applicable patent law.
  </p>

  <h4 id="section12">12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h4>

  <p>
    If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
    covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
    not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
    to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the
    Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License
    would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
  </p>

  <h4 id="section13">
    13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
  </h4>

  <p>
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
    Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting
    with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such
    interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your
    version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network
    server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of
    facilitating copying of software. This Corresponding Source shall include
    the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU
    General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following
    paragraph.
  </p>

  <p>
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to
    link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the
    GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the
    resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part
    which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will
    remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
  </p>

  <h4 id="section14">14. Revised Versions of this License.</h4>

  <p>
    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
    GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
    specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public
    License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
    following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any
    later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does
    not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you
    may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of
    the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's public
    statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose
    that version for the Program.
  </p>

  <p>
    Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
    However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
    holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.
  </p>

  <h4 id="section15">15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h4>

  <p>
    THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
    LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
    SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
    SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  </p>

  <h4 id="section16">16. Limitation of Liability.</h4>

  <p>
    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
    ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
    PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
    OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA
    OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
    PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
    EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
    SUCH DAMAGES.
  </p>

  <h4 id="section17">17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</h4>

  <p>
    If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
    cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing
    courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute
    waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a
    warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in
    return for a fee.
  </p>

  <p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

  <h4 id="howto">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h4>

  <p>
    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
    use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
    which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
  </p>

  <p>
    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the
    exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright"
    line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
  </p>

  <pre>    
    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as
    published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the
    License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
  </pre>

  <p>
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  </p>

  <p>
    If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
    network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get
    its source. For example, if your program is a web application, its interface
    could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive of the code.
    There are many ways you could offer source, and different solutions will be
    better for different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.
  </p>

  <p>
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
    if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For
    more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see &lt;<a
      href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a
