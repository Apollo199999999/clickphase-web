  <p>Version 2, June 1991</p>

  <pre>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>

  <span id="SEC2"></span>
  <h4 id="preamble">Preamble</h4>

  <p>
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
    share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended
    to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure
    the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies
    to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program
    whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation
    software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You
    can apply it to your programs, too.
  </p>

  <p>
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
    General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
    to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you
    wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
    can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
    you know you can do these things.
  </p>

  <p>
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
    deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
    copies of the software, or if you modify it.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
    for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You
    must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you
    must show them these terms so they know their rights.
  </p>

  <p>
    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
    offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
    and/or modify the software.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
    everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If
    the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
    recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any
    problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'
    reputations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
    wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
    individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be
    licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
  </p>

  <p>
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
    follow.
  </p>

  <span id="SEC3"></span>
  <h4 id="terms">
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  </h4>

  <p id="section0">
    <strong>0.</strong>
    This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed
    by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
    General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work,
    and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative
    work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
    "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
  </p>

  <p>
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
    by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program
    is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
    contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
    made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
    Program does.
  </p>

  <p id="section1">
    <strong>1.</strong>
    You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
    receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
    publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;
    keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of
    any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
    along with the Program.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
    may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
  </p>

  <p id="section2">
    <strong>2.</strong>
    You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
    forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
    or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
    these conditions:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>a)</strong>
      You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you
      changed the files and the date of any change.
    </dd>
    <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>b)</strong>
      You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in
      part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed
      as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
    </dd>
    <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>c)</strong>
      If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you
      must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary
      way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright
      notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions,
      and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the
      Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,
      your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
    sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
    reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
    this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
    distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections
    as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
    the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
    licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
    regardless of who wrote it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
    rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
    the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
    based on the Program.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
    the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage
    or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
    License.
  </p>

  <p id="section3">
    <strong>3.</strong>
    You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section
    2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
    provided that you also do one of the following:
  </p>

  <!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
  <!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->

  <dl>
    <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>a)</strong>
      Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
      which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
      customarily used for software interchange; or,
    </dd>
    <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>b)</strong>
      Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
      any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
      source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
      source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on
      a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    </dd>
    <dt></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>c)</strong>
      Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
      corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial
      distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable
      form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
    modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all
    the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
    definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
    installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
    code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
    either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
    and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
    component itself accompanies the executable.
  </p>

  <p>
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
    copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
    source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
    even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with
    the object code.
  </p>

  <p id="section4">
    <strong>4.</strong>
    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly
    provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense
    or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
    under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
    you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.
  </p>

  <p id="section5">
    <strong>5.</strong>
    You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,
    nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its
    derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
    License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based
    on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
    its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or
    works based on it.
  </p>

  <p id="section6">
    <strong>6.</strong>
    Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the
    recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
    distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may
    not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
    granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties
    to this License.
  </p>

  <p id="section7">
    <strong>7.</strong>
    If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
    or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed
    on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions
    of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.
    If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
    this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
    not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not
    permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
    directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
    it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
  </p>

  <p>
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
    the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
    or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
    this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
    software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
    practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
    software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
    application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
    she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a
    licensee cannot impose that choice.
  </p>

  <p>
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
    consequence of the rest of this License.
  </p>

  <p id="section8">
    <strong>8.</strong>
    If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries
    either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder
    who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
    limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
    in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
  </p>

  <p id="section9">
    <strong>9.</strong>
    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General
    Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit
    to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
    Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of
    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
    Foundation.
  </p>

  <p id="section10">
    <strong>10.</strong>
    If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose
    distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.
    For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the
    Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision
    will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives
    of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
  </p>

  <p id="section11"><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>

  <p>
    <strong>11.</strong>
    BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
    PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
    IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS
    IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
    NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS
    WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
    SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  </p>

  <p id="section12">
    <strong>12.</strong>
    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
    COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM
    AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
    INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
    THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
    TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
  </p>

  <h4>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h4>

  <span id="SEC4"></span>
  <h4 id="howto">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h4>

  <p>
    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
    use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
    which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
  </p>

  <p>
    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
    exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright"
    line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
  </p>

  <pre><var>    one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.</var>
    Copyright (C) <var>yyyy</var>  <var>name of author</var>
    
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
    as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
    of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
    
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.
    
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.
    </pre>

  <p>
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when
    it starts in an interactive mode:
  </p>

  <pre>    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) <var>year</var> <var
      >name of author</var>
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
    type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
    to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' 
    for details.
    </pre>

  <p>
    The hypothetical commands <samp>`show w'</samp> and <samp>`show c'</samp>
    should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the
    commands you use may be called something other than
    <samp>`show w'</samp>
    and
    <samp>`show c'</samp>; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu
    items--whatever suits your program.
  </p>

  <p>
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
  </p>

  <pre>    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
    interest in the program `Gnomovision'

  <p>
    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
    proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may
    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
    library. If this is what you want to do, use the
    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html"
      >GNU Lesser General Public License</a>
    instead of this License.
